This isn't just about Delhi; every place in India is unsafe for women. Whenever something happens, men often try to sweep the problem under the rug. I've seen this happen: they'll point out that other countries have higher rape rates, say she shouldn't have been out so late, bring up false rape charges (which are a drop in the ocean), or derail the conversation by saying \"men get raped too.\" Every time men see a problem, they want to ignore it.\n",

All the misogynistic things men say contribute to this.  Those who think of women as objects are shaped by thousands of these tiny, harmful comments. Have you seen the movie Thappad? It addresses this issue—how a husband's casual disregard in minor incidents leads to his wife's public humiliation. Rape is no different.

After finishing my workout, I was getting ready to head out when I noticed a new lady in the gym using the leg press machine. Our trainer had just instructed her on how to use it, and she was doing her second set without any weight on the machine.\n",

            "At first, everything seemed fine. The trainer went off to help other clients, leaving her to continue her workout. Suddenly, though, the machine started to fall on her as she lost control of it. At first, she was just grunting—like the kind of grunt you make when you're pushing through a hard set. But soon, the grunts turned into actual cries of \"Ow, ow!\" That’s when we all realized something was wrong.\n",

            "Here’s the part that’s really stuck with me: none of the guys, including myself, rushed to help her. We were all hesitating, even though it was clear she was in trouble.

            "\n",
            "Afterwards, a bunch of us stood around discussing why we didn’t help sooner, and the reason was unsettling. We all had the same thought: when she first grunted, we figured she might be struggling, but we were too afraid to even look her way, let alone help. There’s this fear that if we tried to help, we could get accused of something, like sexual harassment or eve-teasing. It sounds ridiculous, but in that moment, it felt very real. \n",
            "\n",
            "Even when she started crying out more loudly, we were still hesitant, because that fear was in the back of our minds. And to be honest, because the machine didn’t have any weight on it, we didn’t think she’d actually need help in the first place.\n",
            "\n",

Despite the fact that I have no contact with my friends from high school at this point and I rarely stay in touch with Indian politics or pop culture, I am still an Indian living in America. I take a lot of pride and joy in witnessing India's economic and cultural progress over time. My value system is pretty much at odds with \"narrow mindedness\" of some Indians (based on my observation among the extended family members), but I always figured that Indians will just become more aware of the social injustice around them and start uniting against them as it further develops economically. Maybe I bought into the whole Maslow’s hierarchy a little too much. I am afraid to say that it has only gotten worse.\n",

            "As recently as 2017, my aunt who has been living in the US for 30 years now, told me to not marry a \"BMW\" girl. My cousins who rebel against my uncle and aunt for so many petty things didn't say a word about it. I felt so awkward and ended up saying something about it to my family but no one seemed to care. A few of those incidents have happened now. While I am disappointed by racist and sexist comments by my family members, it appalls me to see American born Indians staying silent about it. By the way, I have observed the same behavior among many (not all) ABCDesi students I met on campus - this isn't just limited to my family.\n",

            "By now most of you are aware of the rape case in Kolkata. The behavior I have observed by Indians online following the incident is sad and disappointing.

While the story is making headlines on social media, instead of owning up and admitting that it's a shame that an incident like that happened in India and uniting against sexual harassment, most of the responses have been about deflecting the actual issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Women are worse off in African and Middle Eastern countries.” - So what? Even if true, none of that changes anything about the incident.

            "\"Not all Indian men are rapist.\" - Yes it's true but response like that is not how you bring a social change. Why are we more concerned about India's image on social media than the safety of our women? Every society is going to have bad apples (living in the US for 15 years and I have seen plenty of their bad apples, but that's not the concern of this post). The way to counter those bad apples isn't to stay silent or say “99% of us are not bad!\", but to own up and shame the predatory behavior. A few million people protesting isn't enough - majority of the citizens must participate to shut down the behavior of those bad apples. Staying silent or saying \"not all of us do it\" is not an option. Either you are part of the solution or you are part of the problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of the above goes for dismantling discriminatory behavior against particular caste, religion, and race too. Don't get me started on discrimination against Africans or anyone with a dark skin tone in India. Don't justify your behavior with \"Imagine if a Hindu walked in a Muslim neighborhood. It would be much worse.\" Let's just assume that it's true. Just because a minority behaves worse than you in general, it doesn't give you a right to be like them. The hope is that we follow a set of values that lead to safe and prosperous society for all citizens. Maybe other communities won't follow those principles just yet, but someone has to start somewhere and it’s a lot easier if the majority follows those principles first. There are many ways to ruin a society, but only a few ways to build a great one. Until we are deeply divided across caste, race, sex, and religion, we aren't going to earn the respect of our citizens, let alone the respect of the rest of the world. And some people want India to be a “Super power”.\n",

Yes you haven't done anything wrong, but the price we pay for living in a democracy is to cultivate a safe society for all citizens. If you have failed to call out and shame predatory behavior, then you have allowed our society to be unsafe for women. You have to own up at least that much and make a change now.

I have no direct control over what Bangladeshi radicals do in their country. I will absolutely expect the Indian government to use whatever influence they have to protect Hindus or any other Indians.

This is a perfect example of deflection. Instead of addressing the issue, let's just make this about an NRI criticizing India. That attitude is the problem. I visit India frequently and may even move to India someday. NRIs moved away because they didn't have good opportunities for themselves in India, but that does not mean they don't care about India. What kind of NRIs do you want? The ones who care and criticize or just leave and forget?

Does India not want safety for all the citizens regardless of race, religion, caste, or sex? Is India not a democracy where citizens have responsibility for shaping the future of our society and actively participating in condemning predatory behavior that violates human rights? Again stop deflecting the issue by bringing America into this. This is about India and I am critiquing our society based on Indian values (or at least what our constitution says).

This is especially relevant for Indian men because sexual encounters don’t come too easily. Porn simulates the rush of being with multiple partners in multiple situations (multiple browser tabs open). Reality can't compete with the novelty and variety of porn. If you’re getting all stimulation in the privacy of your room, you may feel less inclined to improve yourself and be social.\n",
            "\n",
            "Putting yourself out there comes with a risk of rejection. Porn addiction is very very real. It affects you in several other ways as well. Simply put, our brain wants to get 'high'. This 'high' makes it feel like it has hit the evolutionary jackpot. If you're able to sustain this high by sitting at home, alone in your room, and browsing for hours, you will never feel the need to go out.\n",
            "\n",
            "Imagine a situation where your friends invited you to a club, a place where people socialize and have fun. If you sit at home and fap, you're likely to cancel the plan because you've already got your 'high' without the need to spend money, socialize and all that. If you did go to the club, imagine standing alone in a corner feeling anxious and just wanting to get back home (to your computer).\n",

            "\n",
            "Think of porn as a perfect sex robot sitting at home. It will do anything you want. Real partners won't agree to do anything you want. Real people have jobs, lives, problems, insecurities, sometimes even past trauma which stops them from being vulnerable. Trust needs to be established. This takes time.\n",

            "Even if someone is interested in you, it may take a long time to finally have sex (not that it should be the goal). It makes no sense for your porn-addicted brain to put in all this effort for something that can be simulated with the click of a button.\n",
            "\n",
            "In some cases (not all) socially anxiety manifests because your brain is asking you 'What the fuck can these people give you that being at home can't?'. And when you're home, you start feeling guilty for not being out there, doubting your ability to socialize, wondering what happiness is -apart from the few moments of ecstasy when you climax to porn.

            " A female student at NIT Trichy reported a disturbing incident of sexual harassment in her hostel room by a Wi-Fi technician. When she and her friends sought help from hostel authorities, they faced victim-blaming and dismissive attitudes. At the police station, officials made inappropriate comments and seemed more concerned about protecting the institute's reputation than supporting the victim. The student expressed disappointment with the lack of support from the institution and the treatment she received. While the accused is currently in custody, the student remains upset about how the situation was handled and the lack of support she experienced.\n",

            "I was sitting in my room, just looking at my book, when a guy came in to do some Wi-Fi work. Out of nowhere, he started masturbating and he flashed his private parts right in front of me and made sure I noticed that, rubbing himself to get my attention, and gave me this disgusting smirk. He wanted me to see it, to force me to look at it. I felt so grossed out and scared, I had to leave the room. When I came back, he was gone, but there was semen all over the floor. I even had a picture of it which I submitted at the police station.\n",
            "I along with my friends went to the steward to report it, and she gave me a creepy smile while saying, \"I’ve just come, and you’re bothering me with this.\"--- english translation of wht she told me. I was devastated. Later the warden came I hoped they would help. Instead, they all turned against me.\n",
            "They  were like....u guys will be the reason opal wont get wifi. You guys aren't even grateful, we're working so hard for you. (I thought should I get raped to install wifi) They treated this guy with respect calling him \"sir\". In the police station they used phrases like \"she wasn't even wearing pants\" (context I was wearing a full skirt) and tried to put all the blame on me. It was only when the dean came that he said stop calling this guy sir and he's a dog that should be tied. They were all just trying to brush it under the carpet.\n",
            "They did almost everything they could to trigger us, full victim blaming. The entire day I had spent crying cause of people like them. They even threatened my friends that they won't consider any of their electrical/plumbing,etc complaints. And they did all this in the police station. My frnd literally asked what's the use of curfew if we aren't safe inside hostel--- to which the warden replied it's for our safety (guts she has to say this after today's incident). Warden even said you guys should learn martial arts instead of dance and music, you should have beaten him before we came. I wonder wht they would have said if I actually did this? (Who gave you the authority to beat him) When my parents questioned them the same they replied it's not their duty they can't do this.\n",
            "After this I'm not even sure if you all would support me.\n",
            "I wonder if women are really women's biggest enemy. Wht they would do if some girl get's raped.\n",
            "P.s. for your reference the guy is in custody as of now but I'm upset how the events turned and how we got little support from the institute.\n",

            "I'm writing this post after being deeply moved by the recent Abhaya rape and murder case of Bengal. Like many of us, I had grown numb to the constant reports of such incidents, but this case left me shaken and made me reflect on how little we understand about the root causes of rape. Every person avoids the conversation by starting and ending the conversation how laws should be made stricter and how the rapist must be shamed and subjected to gruesome punishments and how their respective religions have opposed it since ages and all the blah blah which uncles and aunties and even some youth make.  \n",
            "I have talked to women who have been raped in the past, some of whom try to suppress the trauma or even convince themselves it wasn’t rape, though the emotional scars remain fresh.\n",

            "I also see a lot of casual misogyny around me, from men joking about rape to some holding a mindset similar to incels like Andrew Tate’s, and it disturbs me. I’ve seen movies perpetuate this entitlement of men, making it seem like rape is almost expected in certain scenarios. I also see women, some who have experienced violence, adopt boisterous or “masculine” personas as a way to protect their vulnerability.\n",
            "\n",
            "While I acknowledge the factors widely discussed, like patriarchy, religious stupidity, lack of education, and economic factors, I want to explore whether there are other psychological or sociological aspects at play that aren't as widely discussed. Is there something in the psyche of a rapist that we’re missing? **Is it driven solely by masculinity, power, anger, or impulse like other crimes**, or is there something unique here? I know rapists are majorly men. But considering that there have been instances of rapes being committed by people of other sexes too begs the question 'are we missing something?'\n",

            "Something I’ve noticed in conversations is that while everybody seems to agree on the need for men to learn respect, they also mention that women should \"dress according to the situation.\" Does that sound ironic? It can definitely be taken as victim blaming easily. Personally, I haven’t seen anyone dressing in a way that felt inappropriate, but I’ve noticed that women who wore shorter skirts or dresses that show cleavages often received unwanted attention, and I’ll admit that there were instances when even I took a quick gaze.   \n",

It started when Brahmins and other oppressor caste people started distinguishing themselves from dalits and adivasis. The idea of working with animals was seen as unclean and impure and used as a tool. Food was literally used as a tool to separate people and spread untouchability. Now, coming to modern day India, a lot of Hindu vegetarian families grow up not knowing how it all started. They assume it's for the animals. Ummm, no. It's about purity.

Because you don't. I'm sick of these Bajrang Dal mentality vegetarian assholes hijacking the animal liberation movement to further their own casteist ideologies.

It was occurring for couple of weeks now already since that daughter came to house to visit their father, so she failed to contain it and exploded a bit back. Can't blame her, you sit, mind your own business and some bitch starts calling you a devil, a slut and other pleasant things out of sudden. But then her brother assaulted her in front of everyone, hit her in the head couple of times, started choking her and hitting her head against the floor. Nobody interfered, her father even praised the bloody bastard. Her another sister who tried to protect her got threatened too and couldn't do much. Her 19-old nephew is a pussy though. She got her left jaw broken, bruises, at the moment she has some constant noise in left ear and can't hear properly with it.  She called the police, but the family convinced the cop who came that she is mad, ignored what she had to say about it. Cop concluded that they should send her to a madhouse and they became seriously enthusiastic about it, unless she becomes \"obedient\". Brave cop saves the day indeed. Doesn't matter that there is a an injured girl right in front of you with a possible concussion and her offender right in front of you and he doesn't even deny it!\n",
            "\n",
            "As for now she escaped the house with her sister that got threatened too and is headed to some apartment she will rent in another state. Her brother set out a watch of some 5 men on the street even, so they waited till they disappeared. Sick, I know.\n",
            "\n",
            "**My question is,** what can be done to protect her from hers family? You see, hers family is irrational. I don't understand their motives. In the past she tried couple of times to live on her own, but family was not letting her (and then making fun of her that she haven't achieved anything, no job, no house, if it's not a gas lighting, then I am Mahatma Gandhi). So, they hate her, despise her, don't want her, but at the same time don't let her go? What is this wickedness? As you understand, they may search for her. Maybe will write a police complaint. They are also a big and seemingly well-known family in their city or whatever, so they will fear for their reputation a lot, I suppose. What can I do or she do to get safe? Are there some organizations in India who help the victims of the abuse? Can it be brought to the court and how it works? Or should she hide until I figure out how to get her out of India? Can she seek refuge in other countries? Since I am a PhD student in Europe, can I contact its Embassy in India to get some help, or Ukrainian one, since I am a citizen? Maybe local Indian embassy in my current country? I will be immensely grateful for any tips or advice you can provide, guys, it will mean a lot to us both.\n",

            ">!Anyways, it is as the title says. Her family is extremely abusive. She is the youngest daughter in a family of 11 children. For some unknown reason she got picked up as a beating bag for her brothers, dad or even some of the sisters (survival, don't wanna get beaten, beat somebody else). Abuse was not only physical, it was mental, psychological, gas lighting, you name it, even financial - she was not getting any allowance unlike others, nor new clothes or things, anything. Just because she was rebellious and was trying to protect her mother from the abuse. Sorry for my in love bias, but she is a true gem among that pile of filth. She is 25 y.o. now. You ask why didn't she leave them by this time? She was staying for her mother and looking after her as she got ill and literally paralyzed until she died 2 years ago. We started being a thing just few month before it happened, those were tough times. Once we met each other, we were building plans on how to get together and stuff, but pandemic just crashed everything. All this time she was trying to get some jobs, but one time out of three HR or CEO were literally asking her to marry them instead of getting hired, other two were just simply ignoring. Becoming really independent was not in the realm of possibilities, and also family kept her loaded with insane amount of housework so she didn't have enough time to hone her IT skills. Oh, and should  I mention that they were forcing her to marry some random dudes? She was rejecting all of them, once she simply shaved all her hair and came out to that guy with proposal, he just ran away? Family just called her mad, but ohh the irony, personally I consider THEM mad instead. !<\n",
            "\n",
            ">!What happened yesterday was the last drop. Things were not physical during the last years, perhaps to not spoil her marriage allure, but everybody seemed to be annoyed with her kindness and not being shit like others. She was getting through the psychological abuse with my help, while was trying to earn some kindness from her family but all was in vain. They were merciless and never appreciated things that she did for them, her sisters called her a slut if she was looking at their husbands (arranged ones) and so on. It can be a whole book and study about the bullshit she went through and I never thought such things exist. !<\n",

            "Content: This is a rant. My boyfriend and I usually have made it a ritual to receive each other from airports or railway stations since we are outstation students. In the past I have gone to pick him up from the airport at 12 am without even thinking twice or getting worried about my safety. However, in light of the recent and horrific events that have been happening in this country, I am so scared and anxious to pick him up. His flight lands at 12, and by the time he deboards and comes out of the gate, it’ll be around 12:30 or so. I stay aprox 20 minutes from the airport and usually leave from home once he gets out of the plane. But now he doesn’t want me to come to pick him up either because he’s worried as well and doesn’t want me to come so late at night. I was looking forward to receiving him from the airport for days since he was gone for long and i just really want to go. The only solution he gave was that I leave my house by around 11/11:15 so that it won’t be too late while I’m on the way to the airport. So now I’m going to have to wait in the airport for aprox 1 and a half hour just so I can be safe. This is the same city where I have traveled at 2am alone without being scared. I know this may seem really petty and small compared to actual real problems women are facing but I just feel so bummed out. We women have to restrict ourselves so much and take so many precautions  just to be safe…\n",

From robbing cab drivers with high commissions and ignore every single major customer complaints to regulate prices and looting us at peak hours. Worse even, they hire the most threatening drivers and is not safe for women at all. That's the edge they get so cab drivers ask for extra money, with scare tactics and we have no choice but to pay since we don't want trouble. Ola has completely gate-kept their customer service portal since 2022 if you notice. The only way to get a human to attend to your case if you talk to the single grievance officer directly (one for whole of India) and he is an uneducated and rude guy who can't be reasoned with. He asks \"Why do you give extra money?\"  - For the safety of myself and to protect the women I accompany, that's why. That's how they treat customers. How you can imagine what the CEO is like if this is the stat of Ola. Now, he criticises Google Maps which his whole business depended on all these years, putting food on his plate. If he ventured out starting in-house in the first place, he would have been bankrupt easily. Google Maps has put food on his plate and he dare just downplays what Google Maps has did for him. His entire innovation and life depended on him and he just comes up to promote his maps by degrading google. I hope people see what is apparent - He doesn't care about customers or humanity, only himself.  \n",

The application showcased the information of the women in a way that the user could “claim a ‘sulli”, which is a derogatory term used by right-wing trolls in India for Muslim women, as the “deal of the day”. The aim of the application was to objectify and demean the targeted women by allowing them to be auctioned for sale to the users of the application.\n",

Additionally, the [**Delhi Commission for Women**](https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/national-commission-for-women-takes-suo-moto-cognisance-after-photos-of-muslim-women-uploaded-on-sulli-deal-app) also issued notice to the Delhi Police on the incident and asked for a detailed action taken report. Subsequently, the [**Cyber Cell of Delhi Police registered FIRs under S. 354-A of the Indian Penal Code**](https://thewire.in/women/sulli-deals-github-delhi-police-fir) which relates to sexual harassment. Additionally, one of the targeted women, Pilot Hana Khan, also **filed a FIR** with the Delhi Police under S. 509 of the IPC which relates to acts intended to insult the modesty of a woman and S. 66 & 67 of the Information Technology Act which relates to hacking and publishing of obscene information in electronic form respectively.\n",

            "While indeed these are relevant provisions, we feel they fail to adequately address the nature of the crime in the current incident. The application categorically targeted women belonging to the Muslim community and therefore, this is not only an act of gender based harassment but also an instance of targeting on the basis of religion. The application targeted these women specifically because of their religious identity as the aim of the application was not just to sexually harass women but to also demean Muslim women and their community by objectifying them and reducing them to “auction items”. This is evident from the fact that the application title itself contains a derogatory slang term used to denote Muslim women specifically and not just women in general. Therefore, we are of the view that while the provisions related to sexual harassment, insult to the modesty of a woman and publication of obscene information are relevant here, this investigation is incomplete unless and until the Delhi Police as well as the NCW & the DCW take cognisance of the fact that this incident was religiously motivated.\n",

            "2. Section 295 A of the IPC which penalises  “deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs”.\n",
            "3. Section 298 of the IPC which punishes anyone who “with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person or makes any gesture in the sight of that person or places, any object in the sight of that person.”\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Displaying sensitive information without consent to intimidate and/or harass women is violative of Art. 21 of the Indian Constitution**: The application conducted a “auction” of the targeted Muslim women for over 20 days, by using sensitive information like the photographs and social media handles of the women. Needless to say, these “deals” elicited lewd, perverse and horrifying comments from a vast number of users. While there was no actual auction of any human being, the main goal of this application was to dehumanise and intimidate women who were targeted. This has affected the personal safety and security of those targeted, thus violating their constitutional right to life, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and has undermined their right to privacy, deemed an integral component of the “right to life” by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India’s decision in *KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India* (2017) 10 SCC 1.  \n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Doxxing and online harassment of women infringes upon the freedom of speech and expression of women**: Social media platforms are the town halls of our modern times. Yet, the persistent incidents of sexual harassment and doxxing have made these platforms highly unsafe and toxic for women, ultimately leading them to disengage from social media altogether after facing harassment. According to a study conducted by Plan International, one in every five young women have opted out of social media after being targeted or harassed. The abuses are further aggravated in cases of women who voice their opinions as well as those women who belong to minority communities on social media platforms and in turn, dissuade them from expressing themselves without any fear or inhibitions. This squarely violates the women’s right to freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution.  \n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Delayed response to curb the spread of such vitriolic information undermines the digital security of women online**: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, your terms of service lack the obligation to protect the data collected or govern the sharing of such sensitive information, within the purview of purpose limitation and exacerbates the privacy and security threats. Further, in the absence of any narrowly defined safeguards against data breach, practices of doxxing and online sexual harassment can continue with impunity. Moreover, the failure of the law enforcement bodies to initiate any prompt action is likely to cause a loss of deterrence for similar miscreants.\n",
            "4. **Instances of online harassment has vitiated the experience of internet use for women all across the world**: According to a survey of more than 8,000 respondents undertaken by the [**Web Foundation**](https://webfoundation.org/2020/03/the-online-crisis-facing-women-and-girls-threatens-global-progress-on-gender-equality/), “half of young women and girls in the global survey have experienced online abuse, including threatening messages, sexual harassment and the sharing of private photos and videos without permission”.\n",

For instance, according to NCRB data from 2016, 94.6% of rapes in India are committed by perpetrators known to the victim such as family members, friends or acquaintances.

Chapter 5 of the report dealt exclusively with cyber crimes against women and children. In it, the Committee noted that, with respect to the challenges in dealing with cyber crimes:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. In instances where the offender is not located in the state in which a cyber crime has been committed, local law enforcement must provide optimum support to the travelling investigating officers .\n",
            "2. Better coordination with foreign cyber crime agencies is necessary to curb trans-national cyber crimes.\n",
            "3. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) allow their users to bypass security walls and allow criminals to retain a sense of anonymity, and so these VPNs must be permanently blocked.\n",
            "\n",
            "Basically, the committee asked the MHA to work with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to block VPNs and to ‘strengthen tracking and surveillance mechanisms’!\n",
            "\n",
            "MeitY responded to these recommendations by stating that section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 allows the government to block public access to information in certain cases such as in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India. Additionally, MeitY said that the blocking of information is done either in compliance of a court order or in pursuance of the recommendation of an inter-ministerial committee constituted under the [**Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information for Public) Rules, 2009**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28%20Procedure%20and%20safeguards%20for%20blocking%20for%20access%20of%20information%20by%20public%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf).

            "\n",
            "1. Once a user has downloaded the VPN software, all their data traffic is encrypted by the software before being transmitted. This encrypted data is then transmitted over the internet. This helps prevent telecom service providers from snooping in on the traffic data of subscribers and end users.  \n",
            "\n",
            "2. Now, the encrypted data is received by both the user’s Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) server as well as the VPN server. However, the ISP cannot track the user’s data as it is encrypted. On the other hand, the VPN server decrypts the data and forwards the web request to the relevant website. Once it receives the requested information (such as, for example, a web page or an email), the VPN server encrypts this information and sends it back towards the user over the internet.  \n",
            "\n",
            "3. This process ends when the encrypted information is decrypted by the user’s local VPN software and served to the user. Once again, as it is encrypted, the ISP cannot track this information.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Why VPNs are important\n",
            "\n",
            "VPNs help to protect information security in multiple ways. Firstly, VPNs are increasingly used by business and government agencies to secure confidential information online. Not only do VPNs provide a secure channel for storing and sharing information,  organisations can also use their local VPNs to provide remote access to network resources for their employees. For these very reasons, the [**usage of business VPNs is increasing**](https://www.techradar.com/in/news/business-vpn-usage-likely-to-remain-high-even-as-the-pandemic-subsides), especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic induced filip to digitalisation. Industry response to the media reports about the proposed ban on VPNs has illustrated these concerns, with businesses saying that such a move would be “[**counterproductive**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/proposal-to-ban-vpns-has-india-inc-worried/article36235330.ece)” as organisations employing work-from-home protocols have been using VPNs to conduct their business remotely. [**Businesses have also deployed VPNs to secure sensitive information**](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/article/parl-committee-suggests-banning-vpns-why-the-move-could-prove-problematic-for-india-inc/806360).\n",
            "\n",
            "These realities have also been recognised by the government, as can be seen by steps taken to encourage work-from-home protocols in the IT sector: on 5th November, 2020, the Ministry of Communications announced [**new guidelines for Other Service Providers (OSPs) in the IT industry**](https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/OSP%20Guidelines%2005.11.2020.pdf). These guidelines allowed OSPs to use VPNs to integrate call networks and sanctioned the use of private VPNs. This illustrates the necessity of VPNs for modern economic activity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Contrary to popular perception, cyber security experts often promote VPNs to help keep internet users safe and their sensitive personal information private. During FY 2020-21, [**59% of Indian adults were victims of a cyber crime**](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/over-59-of-indian-adults-fell-victim-to-cyber-crime-over-past-12-months-report-11618827697551.html). The increase in cyber crimes and online fraud has made protecting data security important for individuals. As a result, many citizens are resorting to the use of VPN services to secure their information: in the first six months of 2021,[ **India saw 348.7 million VPN installations, a year on year growth of 671%.**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vpn-use-in-india-grows-over-600-in-h121-report/articleshow/85412089.cms) The comprehensive encryption protocols generally deployed by VPNs secure user data against diverse threats and provide citizens with an effective tool to fight online profiling for commercial purposes.\n",
            "\n",
            "VPNs also help secure digital rights under the Constitution of India specially for journalists, whistleblowers and activists. The encrypted nature of information transfer over VPNs allows them to not only to secure the confidential information but also to safeguard their own identity, thus protecting them from surveillance and censorship. VPNs as a privacy advancing technology that often implement encryption protocols fall squarely within the protection of the fundamental right to privacy articulated by the Supreme Court in the [**Right to Privacy judgement**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/).\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, there are increasing instances wherein ISPs continue to discriminate against certain types of internet content and block them with impunity. These instances conform with observations from a l[**arger study published by the Centre for Internet and Society**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08590). In it, researchers found that the website blocklists of licensed internet service providers (ISPs) across India are widely inconsistent with one another, suggesting that a larger pattern wherein internet providers are either a) not complying with blocking orders or b) arbitrarily blocking websites without legal orders. Given that the Department of Communications is [**yet to operationalise the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s recommendations**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-the-dot-doing-a-rethink-on-net-neutrality-we-press-for-transparency-and-enforcement-savetheinternet/) on enforcing net neutrality, VPNs are a key tool in the fight for net neutrality as they allow users to sidestep arbitrary blockings of websites by ISPs that are without any legal basis.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Our suggestions\n",
            "\n",
            "As has been pointed out by MEITY, legal instruments for the blocking of content already exist under section 69A of the Information Technology Act for specific websites and domains. With respect to requests for user information there exist mechanisms under [**Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty processes**](https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/ISII_ComprehensiveGuidelines16032020.pdf) as well as provisions under the [**Code of Criminal Procedure**](https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1974-02.pdf) which are often used by police departments. While greater coordination with foreign agencies is necessary to curb cyber crimes, such steps that may include operationaising and entry under the US Cloud Act are contingent on the passage of a data protection law and surveillance reforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "We acknowledge the concerns of the Standing Committee and are aligned to make online communications safer for women and children. However, the proposal to ban VPNs will harm individual liberty and privacy, and are likely to be held unconstitutional. Thus, we call on the MHA to consider any such proposal only after seeking legal opinion and further opening up a public consultation process that is inclusive of criminologists, technologists, industry and civil society organisations, specially those with a focus on digital rights. This will help further the objective of ensuring public safety, especially of women and children, while protecting and advancing privacy preserving technologies.\n",

            "Before I start let me tell you a small life story of my first proposal that till today taught me a lot. A month or two before exams a few of neighborhood friends and me decided to take private group tuitions. This is where I met my crush. So after boards, JEE mains and advanced and BITSAT all had ended we used to hang out a bit often. One day while we came back from lunch because her birthday's party was due, I told her that I had developed something for her that I couldn't explain. She said she got to know by my actions and a very caring attitude and treatment. So I still remember we were D block parking, CP where she told me these lines that I try to quote nearly what I remember. \"I have no feelings for you and I have to say NO to you. It might hurt you today but you'll remember me for good.\" \n",
            "That moment was the most heartbreaking moment for me, I won't lie I didn't say a word, left her alone there, took a metro and came back home. On the way back I deleted her number, deleted the message chat on my phone. I accepted her decision, though I cried but did accept. After about 10-12 days we meet, I have no feelings for her anymore like 85% were dead, 15% remained because she was my crush. She hugged me and said sorry for she was rude(which she wasn't) and I too said sorry for leaving her alone and coming back home and deleting her number and everything immature I did. \n",
            "\n",
            "So to this day we are great friends and she has been an amazing advisor to me. How did that happen? It's because she didn't keep me on strings and told me one word i.e. **NO**. She didn't make pathetic excuses, kept me on hold or played with my emotions. What if she had played with me? I couldn't answer that but eventually found out as I grew up.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jumping back to the present stage. A few weeks backs I announced at the LNRDT that I am going on my first date after a long time. I was really excited. I trimmed my hair, shaved my beard, chose perfect shirt and jeans and took out my new sneakers. Told mom I was going on my X friend's birthday in a cafe in CP. Though she might have guessed it's entirely a different story. I get a WhatsApp maybe hour or so before leaving that due to hot weather she can't make it as her parents aren't allowing. I thought it might be genuine concern and then said let's catch-up someday evening. I was pretty much sad but somehow consoled myself that it's just being shifted and not being cancelled. That's when things started to get shady. She gradually stopped reply to my texts and when I finally asked her about 10 days later why is she playing with me and ghosting me she told me \"She was sorry to play around me, but she had found someone else who was more compatible and *taller* than me.\" I said ok bye. I hung up, deleted her chats and number and remembered the my first rejection.\n",

In the meanwhile they use our goodness and services and we act as their butlers, keeping track of their lives, sharing their happiness and being with them in their times of hardship. \n",

Then drops the nuclear missile, \"See I don't want to lose a caring human being like you, in these few days we have become more like best friends but not a couple.\"\n",
            "* The guys pretty much get into the guilty feeling of losing such an amazing human being in life and settle for sticking around as a friend killing all the feelings after being put on strings and never told a straight forward NO.\n",

            "* Even if the above scenario doesn't take place, it's alternative takes place. Where comes in the close friends WhatsApp groups that has screenshots of the guys pictures, all chats and girls mocking how that guy doesn't her standards and too average to be presentable. Instead of again telling a **NO** game is played, excuses are built up and a whole circle of the same activity takes place, where eventually the guy suffers as he is emotionally drained, stuck in between like a dhobi ka kutta (washerman's dog). Can't even get away from her because friendship and can't even come closer because standards don't match and he is kept for entertainment purposes.\n",

Well no denying they have to deal with psychos, but also they get out of that situation easily by always making the same excuse. For that no one would blame them thanks to such crass people who share the same gender with us. Who ends up at the real receiving end? Ofcourse the average looking guys. Because we don't have anything of our own after we propose or luckily get into a relationship with a woman up a higher notch. She is the holder of our emotions, she can blackmail us easily because we aren't her level and she has done a massive favour for us. She controls us emotionally and mentally. And in that process we get torn into bits and pieces. **The excuses and keeping us on strings where straightway a harsh and hurting truth in form of NO, could have been told, we get more agressive and much more fanatic.

It's somewhere our fault too that we fail to take note of all that glitters is not gold kind of situation. That we fail to move on rather than going down the spiral.

Immediately, because of his language and because he said he'd call the police (getting angrier because friend was okay with the idea and said the police should be called) things got loud and I step outside to have the grandmother scream at me in punjabi about how I had men in the house and have no shame. The whole problem was really me and my flatmate being close to 30 and being unmarried. This is a prime area in the capital of the city. She then calls the RWA president who wa filthy, vulgar and went batshit crazy because 'friend-going-for-PhD' hugged a woman as he saw her off into an uber - that's it. She lost her shit at a hug. We tried to talk to her as calmly as possible even having to request that she give us ten seconds to talk but her entire monologue was vulgar, aimed at trying to shame us, accuse us of things we definitely have never done and asking us to leave the complex several times - 'we're not family type'. Also then sent in a guard to tell us to finish the party and that if it's not over the police will be called. We continued and no police was called. It would have been better if they were - we are all over 25, so the bottles of alcohol weren't a problem and we were literally just sitting around in the living room and talking, not even too loud. oh and turns out they're going through our trash - they found condoms and cigarette butts and were sitting on that piece of information waiting for a day like this to tell us - THEY LITERALLY HAVE SOMEONE CHECKING TENANTS TRASH.

Why does it seem like there is a lack of awareness? I must be missing part of the picture, right??\\n\\nThere are so many tips and tricks women pass on to each other to stay safe and vigilant that we don't share around men for obvious reasons. At the same time, these big questions I\\u2019ve seen frequently in the last month on Reddit make me think that's possibly less true in some ways.\\n\\nExamples: where can I buy pepper spray? What should I get for safety? What do I do if my boss is harassing me? What do I do if my family is abusing me? What do I do if a friend or I was raped? The list goes on and on and on. And the people responding to these posts to not have much advice.\\n\\nThere are also instances when it's not a safety issue. Example: How can I tell my partner their snoring keeps me awake every night? \\n\\nMen also seem not to know. I've seen guys ask \\u201cWhat can I do if a guy is harassing my friend?\\u201d and \\u201cWhat can I do if my friend was raped?\\u201d\\n\\nWhy don\\u2019t people know what to do in emergencies? Are nationwide services not user friendly and widely known to women in India? Doesn't Amazon sell pepper spray? Why can't you tell your life partner simple things like their snoring is disturbing your sleep and that you'd like to brainstorm solutions to the problem together? It doesn't have to be snoring. It could be bad breath or anything bothering/concerning you. \\n\\nEdit: why are people downvoting this post? \\n\\n- - -\\n\\nEdit 2: This is a drafted post that I'm now adding here:\\n\\nI\\u2019m looking for reliable nationwide or state websites focused on emergencies, prevention, and empowerment. (also looking for MMA clubs, relationship books, lawyers, etc.) If you know any, please share! I want to share this info whenever I see an SOS post.\\n\\nHere are some that I found: \\nvandrevalafoundation.com, aasra.info, ncw.nic.in Women\\u2019s helpline 181\\n\\nI'm also curious about what might prevent some women from using these resources. Can we encourage them to take advantage of what's available? \\n\\nIf anyone's interested and thinks it is fitting, we can collaborate on creating a user friendly site with all the resources we collect. I have experience in web design.\\n\\nI'm moving to India for a bit, so it's a personal priority too. I've also done advocacy work related to my psychology studies in my country with people from all walks of life.\",\n          \"posting a story on instagram won't make a difference. we need to change how we view women. Often, crimes against women get attention only after the victim is killed and only if society thinks she was \\\"respectable.\\\" Social media and the news might briefly focus on the crime, but it rarely leads to real change. People quickly call for harsh punishments like \\\"hang the rapists\\\" but this just becomes a hot topic for news and then disappears into thin air without any true action upon those rapists.\\n\\nAsk yourself: Are we truly making a difference, or are we merely engaging in performative activism? the reality is that posting on social media doesn't challenge the deeply rooted societal norms that allow such violence to persist.\\n\\nResearch shows that rape is not about arousal but about power and control. Some men feel a sense of superiority, viewing themselves as protectors and women as inferior, weak and pathetic beings. We need to introspect and understand that both men and women are equal. Nobody is superior. Think about how often we excuse inappropriate behavior towards women as \\\"boys being boys.\\\" How frequently do we ignore patriarchal comments or actions from our friends and not even hold them accountable for their actions? how often do we judge women based on their appearance rather than their abilities? how frequently do we disrespect a woman for having multiple partners or being sexually active?\\nwe live in a society that objectifies women as sexual objects and normalizes rape within marriage as if it's just a part of marriage. \\n\\nWe are the same society that sensationalizes a woman's (tripti) sensuality rather than her other movies. We applaud when a woman from a particular community is raped, and we elect ministers or parties led by those with histories of sexual violence. it high time to realize that rapists are not born, but they are made by the members of our society. Rape culture is embedded in our day to day lives, and outrage after a horrific incident alone will not eradicate this culture. Rape is the result of a long history of patriarchy.\\n\\nso, when you ask, \\\"how could they have raped her so brutally? how did they not shiver? are they even human?\\\" remember that we are all part of the system that allows this violence. it's up to us to address and change this culture. \\n\\nwhen i say we are all part of the system that allows this violence, i mean it's rape culture. rape culture is when sexual violence is accepted as normal. it's when patriarchy criticizes women for making their own choices or living independently and blames rape survivors for what happened to them. if a woman is raped, she was \\\"asking for it,\\\" and if a man is raped, he was \\\"weak,\\\" a \\\"sissy,\\\" or\\n\\\"enjoyed it.\\\" it promotes the idea of \\\"don't get raped\\\" instead of \\\"don't rape people.\\\"\\n\\nwhen you hear in response to a rape, \\\"she shouldn't have been drunk/wearing that/etc.,\\\" that is what \\\"rape culture\\\" refers to. it's rape culture when a woman is going about her business and men start catcalling her, either on the street or from a car. it's not about wanting to talk to her, it's about showing off to other men. do you know how scary it is to be followed by a group of strangers making derogatory comments? or when people make inappropriate jokes that make women uncomfortable, and if they voice their discomfort, it's often dismissed as 'just a joke' and they're told to 'stop being so sensitive.\\u201d\\n\\nIt\\u2019s messed up that women are expected to worry about their safety when it's the patriarchy making them unsafe. Catcalling isn\\u2019t just annoying\\u2014it\\u2019s scary, and brushing it off as a joke when someone asks you to stop just shows you don\\u2019t care about their feelings.\\n\\nCalling for 'hanging rapists' without doing anything to actually dismantle rape culture is like thinking you can cure a disease by just getting rid of the sick. Real change needs all of us to put in the work.\",\n          \"Scrap 2036 Olympic hosting ideas and focus more on how we can improve safety of women.\\n\\nHere are some ideas they can implement;\\n\\n1. Ads on tv especially in non cities and non urban areas, showing how a women feels everytime she steps outside of her own home or sometimes home is not a safe place and as men how can we make India safer for women \\n\\n2. In schools, having a practical lesson on listening to the struggles women face and having in depth conversations with women as men to understand their perspective, this can be done at all levels from school/colleges to corporate offices \\n\\n3. Incentivising people to report suss men who endanger women safety, before an incident happens, so could be like a hotline where people can report and as community actions we can take to improve women\\u2019s safety, because when it comes to the crowd, all they do is watch and not help and that\\u2019s not enough \\n\\n4. Ads targeting community, cause victim shaming seems to be the norm in our society, working on strategies to not thrown rocks at victims but rather help them and if you can hurt the perpetrator\\n\\n5.
